## Greetings

Hey there!
Welcome to the Prexo AI documentation! Here, you'll find everything you need to get started with our cool Agentic AI stuffs and how to use them in your projects.

### Founder's Note

Prexo AI is a side project that started as a personal experiment to create an AI assistant that can help with various tasks. Over time, it has evolved into a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of applications. We are excited to share it with you and hope you find it useful in your projects.

One of the applications we are most excited about is the [AI Chat SDK](/app/ai-chat-sdk/intro), which allows you to easily integrate Agentic AI chat capabilities into your applications. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up and using the SDK, as well as provide examples and best practices.

Btw, hey this is me [Saidev Dhal](https://devwtf.in) if you feel like reaching out to me directly. Just shoot a message on [WhatsApp](https://l.devwtf.in/wp) or [connect.saidev@gmail.com](mailto:connect.saidev@gmail.com).

## Getting Started

In order to get started with Prexo AI, we recommend you to check out the [Quick Start Guide](/app/quick-start) which will walk you through the process of setting up the SDK in your application.

You can also check out the [SDK Guide](/app/ai-chat-sdk/intro) for more detailed information on how to use the SDK and its features.

If you just want to use our Agentic API without the SDK, you can check out the [API Guide](/app/api/intro) for more information on how to use the API directly.
